# BD2ModPreview

A **minimal Spine animation viewer** used internally by [**BD2ModManager**](https://github.com/bruhnn/BD2ModManager).

---

## Overview

**BD2ModPreview** is a lightweight, standalone `.exe` for previewing Spine mod animations.  
It is designed specifically for use with **BD2ModManager** and is **not** a full-featured Spine viewer.

---

## Usage

While this tool is normally launched by **BD2ModManager**, you can run it manually:

```bash
BD2ModPreview.exe <path-to-mod-folder>
```
The mod folder must include:

- .skel or .json file
- .atlas file
- Corresponding .png texture(s)
